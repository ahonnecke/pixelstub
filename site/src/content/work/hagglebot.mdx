## Problem

Negotiating vehicle purchases involves managing simultaneous conversations with multiple dealerships, tracking price points across threads, and maintaining strategic positioning — all manually.

## Approach

I built **Hagglebot**, an AI-powered negotiation assistant that automates the haggling process. It manages email conversations with multiple dealerships simultaneously, analyzes dealer responses, identifies price offers, and generates strategic counter-offers.

Key capabilities:

- **Multi-dealer Management** — Maintains context across lengthy negotiations with multiple parties
- **NLP Extraction** — Identifies price points, incentives, and special conditions from dealer messages
- **Strategic Responses** — Generates counter-offers that advance the buyer's position
- **Conversation Tracking** — Full history and context for each negotiation thread

## Technologies

- React frontend
- Python backend API
- NLP for message analysis
- Docker containerization
- Email service integration

## Outcome

Hagglebot demonstrated practical AI application — automating a complex social interaction that involves nuanced language understanding, strategic decision-making, and multi-party coordination. It reduced the time and cognitive load of vehicle negotiations while consistently pushing for better pricing.
