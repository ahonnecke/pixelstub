## Problem

AWS SNS messages are ephemeral — there's no built-in way to inspect what a topic is emitting without subscribing via email or SMS, which isn't practical for debugging. When troubleshooting event-driven architectures, you need to see messages in real time.

## Approach

I built **Snifter** to solve this. It creates a temporary SQS queue, subscribes it to your SNS topic, and watches incoming messages — all in a single command.

Key capabilities:

- **Live Streaming** — Watch SNS messages in real time with minimal setup
- **Interactive Debugging** — Add `--debug` to drop into a debugger as messages arrive
- **Clean CLI** — Works with any AWS profile and topic ARN

## Technologies

- Python, AWS SDK (boto3)
- AWS SNS, SQS
- PyPI for distribution

## Outcome

Snifter turned a multi-step manual process (create queue, subscribe, poll, clean up) into a single command. It's a lightweight, throwaway tool for understanding what an SNS topic is emitting without setting up permanent infrastructure.
