## Problem

Small investors lack access to commercial real estate markets. Traditional NNN (Triple Net Lease) properties require large capital outlays and complex legal structures that exclude most individual investors.

## Approach

I developed **Rentinity**, a blockchain-based platform for fractional real estate investment. The system implements the complete property investment lifecycle:

- **Property Tokenization** — ERC-20 tokens on Polygon representing fractional ownership
- **LLC Formation** — Wyoming Series LLC structure for each property
- **Investor Dashboard** — React-based interface for portfolio management
- **Automated Distribution** — Rent payments distributed automatically via traditional rails and cryptocurrency
- **Governance** — Token-weighted voting system for property decisions

## Technologies

- Solidity smart contracts (ERC-20)
- Polygon blockchain
- React dashboard
- KYC verification systems
- Traditional payment rails + crypto payments

## Outcome

Rentinity bridged traditional finance with blockchain technology, creating a pathway for smaller investors to access commercial real estate. The platform handled the full lifecycle from seller onboarding through tokenization to automated rent distribution.
