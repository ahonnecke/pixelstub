## Problem

Developing against AWS Lambda functions requires constant upload/download cycles. There's no native way to edit Lambda code locally and see changes take effect immediately — the feedback loop is slow and frustrating.

## Approach

I built **Consolo**, a free and open-source utility that pseudo-mounts an AWS Lambda filesystem locally. It watches for file changes and automatically syncs them to the Lambda function, giving you a hot-reload development experience for serverless code.

Key capabilities:

- **Hot Syncing** — Automatically syncs local changes to Lambda in real time
- **Upload and Download** — Push or pull Lambda code with a single flag
- **Simple Install** — Available via `pip install consolo` or a single curl command

## Technologies

- Python (argdantic, requests, watchdog, boto3)
- AWS Lambda, S3
- PyPI for distribution

## Outcome

Consolo eliminated the manual upload/download cycle from Lambda development. It reduced iteration time from minutes to seconds, and became useful enough to publish as an open-source package on PyPI. It's a good example of building lightweight, practical tools that improve everyday developer workflows.
