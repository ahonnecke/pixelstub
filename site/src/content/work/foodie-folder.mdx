## Problem

Food enthusiasts have no structured way to document dishes they've tried across restaurants. Notes get scattered across photos, texts, and memory. Menu items lack context after the meal is over.

## Approach

I developed **Foodie Folder**, a mobile application built with Expo and React Native. Users capture images of restaurant menus, which are processed through OCR to extract and structure dish information automatically.

Key capabilities:

- **Menu Scanning** — Camera capture with OCR to extract dish names and descriptions
- **Personal Ratings** — Add notes and ratings for each dish
- **Search & Browse** — Find past entries by dish, restaurant, or rating
- **Food Diary** — Build a personalized culinary history over time

## Technologies

- React Native + Expo for cross-platform mobile
- Tesseract.js for OCR processing
- Structured data model for menu items
- App Store distribution

## Outcome

Foodie Folder turned an unstructured problem (remembering what you ate and whether you liked it) into a searchable, organized system. The OCR pipeline eliminates manual data entry, and the app is available on the App Store.
